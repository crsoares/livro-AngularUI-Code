Dear reviewer,

Please download AngularJS 1.2.21 as a zip file (https://code.angularjs.org/1.2.21/angular-1.2.21.zip) and place the angular.js file inside the src/js/vendor folder.

For the tests in step 5 and 6 you also need to place angular-mocks.js from the same zip file inside test/lib. For step 6 you also need to place angular-scenario.js in the same folder.

Thanks,
Matthias
