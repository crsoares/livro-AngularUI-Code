Accompanying code samples and snippets for the **[AngularJS UI Development Book](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/angularjs-ui-development)** by **[Amit Gharat](https://github.com/codef0rmer)** and **[Matthias Nehlsen](https://github.com/matthiasn)**.

AngularJS and its rich set of components solve many of the problems developers face when writing reliable single page applications in ways that would not be possible using other frameworks. This book will help you expand your horizons by teaching you the skills needed to successfully design, customize, build, and deliver real-world applications in AngularJS. We will start off by setting up a fully automated environment to quickly scaffold, test, and deploy any application. Along the way, we'll cover how to design and build production-ready applications to demonstrate how innovative and powerful AngularJS is. By leveraging CSS3 animations, we'll convert them into intuitive and native-like applications in no time. You will also learn how to use Grunt for application-specific task management, Bower to manage dependencies with external libraries/plugins, Git for better versioning, and Karma and Protractor for automated testing to build applications the way experts do.

You will **learn** all this by building **real-world applications including a to-do application, Github dashboard, project management application, and many more**.

## How to use the code
Before you run any example in a browser, please make sure you have NodeJS and NPM pre-installed. Then proceed to install the following pre-requisite NPM packages with following commands in a terminal (Use sudo if required):

    npm install -g karma-cli

    npm install –g grunt-cli

    npm install -g http-server

    npm install -g bower

    npm install –g protractor

    webdriver-manager update

Follow along Chapter 1 in the book for detailed instructions. **Please resolve client-side dependencies locally with NPM and Bower as mentioned in README.md file in each chapter directory above.**
